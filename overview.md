The British National Bibliography (BNB) is a bibliographic database that contains information on a wide range of books and serial publications that have been published in the UK and Ireland since the 1950s. The database is available under a public domain license and can be accessed via an online API.

This project contains a number of sample SPARQL queries for working with the [British National Bibliography Linked Data](http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datafree.html#lod).

The public SPARQL endpoint for the dataset can be found at:

	http://bnb.data.bl.uk/sparql

This documentation provides access to a number of sample queries which have been tested against the live dataset and are known to return useful results.

The original source for the queries can be [found on github](https://github.com/ldodds/bnb-queries).
